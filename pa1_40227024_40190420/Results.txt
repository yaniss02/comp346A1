\f0\fs24 \cf0 As seen in the test cases, increasing the size of the buffer would make the program slightly faster, because i\expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0

However, it would not be a significant difference, since we are testing this program on a fairly powerful machine, with a quite small sample. Also, re running the program several times will give different results, since we know the network thread will run first, but the remaining of the program can vary since we do not necessarily know which thread gets executed first after that, we can only control which ones yield when it needs to wait for another one. }
